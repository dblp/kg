In this repository you will find information about the **dblp Knowledge Graph (dblp KG)** and its SPARQL endpoint (https://sparql.dblp.org).

The dblp KG aims to make all semantic relationships modeled in the **dblp computer science bibliography** (https://dblp.org) explicit and machine-actionable. This includes structured information already available via dblp's APIs, like the authorship of publications, as well as information that has not been published explicitly before. In the current, second major iteration of the knowledge graph, this additional information includes the concrete linkage of published works with the publication venue they appeared in (conferences, journals, etc.), metadata about these venues, and information about known relations between venues. Future iterations of the graph will expand the model even further. This will include such information as metadata about conference events within a conference series, and author affiliations.

The dblp KG is not merely based on a one-time snapshot of dblp data, but is actively synchronized with the current data. In particular, the dblp KG benefits from the continuing curation work of the dblp team.
